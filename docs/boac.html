                        <p class="lead">
                        	The first "visita" was established in 1580 and it was called "Monserrat de Marinduque" (now Boac) with Fray Alonzo Banol as its minister.
							In 1621, the Spanish Jesuit missionaries brought the three-foot Marian image to Boac. So began the people's devotion to the image of the Virgin Mary.
							In the mid-17th century, a group of Muslims in the Philippines called the Moro people felt threatened by the actions of the ruling Spanish government. They challenged the government by launching attacks on coastal Christian towns. This resulted in a raid along the shores of Barangay Laylay, near the Boac River.[6]
							During the siege, the neighbourhood people fled in panic and took refuge in the fortress church of Boac, which is now called Immaculate Conception Cathedral. In the meantime, all able-bodied men defended the outer walls of the church fortress against the attacks. Many Christians were killed and, by the third day of violence, those alive began to run short on food. The capture of the fortress seemed imminent.
							The survivors prayed fervently at the throne of Mary, asking her to deliver them from their enemies. Legend says that suddenly there came a very strong storm, with torrential rain, thunder and lightning. At the very height of the storm, it is reported that the image of a beautiful lady with outstretched arms appeared standing on the top of the wall. Terror seized the Moros and they fled in confusion to their vinta boats. Thus, the Christians were saved from death by Mary.
							Ever since this incident, the image of Mary has been honoured and given the title "Biglang Awa." To commemorate the miracle, a stone niche was built on the wall at the spot where Mary appeared. The old image brought by the Jesuits in Boac was placed there. There is a shrine at this location today.
							In 1942, Boac was occupied by Japanese troops. In 1945, the Battle of Marinduque began and the American-Philippine Commonwealth troops landed in Boac after the war was built of the general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary from 1945 to 1946 station in this municipality.
							The Provincial Government of Marinduque under Gov. Carmencita O. Reyes built a larger-than-life-size image of the Our Lady of Biglang Awa in cement and placed in the seashore in Balanacan Port to welcome travelers to the island.
							On May 10, 2008, the Diocese of Boac celebrated the 13th anniversary and the golden anniversary of the canonical coronation of Mahal na Birhen ng Biglang-Awa (1958â€“2008). Cebu Archbishop-Cardinal Ricardo Vidal of Mogpog, Marinduque, officiated at the consecrated mass.
